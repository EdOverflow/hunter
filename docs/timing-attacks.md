# Timing Attacks

Timing attacks are a type of side channel attack where one can discover valuable information by recording the time it takes for a cryptographic algorithm to execute.

### üëé Don't use this:

~~~
return "digest_abc" == "digest_xyz"
~~~

The `==` and `!=` operations do a byte-by-byte comparison of two values and as soon as the two differentiate they terminate. In the example above the operation returns when it detects `a` and `x` are the not the same. 

This means the longer it takes until the operation returns, the more correct characters the attacker has guessed.

### üëç Use this instead:

~~~
hmac.compare_digest(a, b)
~~~

The `compare_digest()` function does not terminate as soon as two bytes are not the same.

Many of the recommended password hashing modules listed in the "Password Storage" document come with a ready made time independent comparison function. The bcrypt package uses the `checkpw()` function.

~~~
import bcrypt


def bcrypt_password():
    password = b"hunter2"
    hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password, bcrypt.gensalt())
    if bcrypt.checkpw(password, hashed):
        print("It matches! :)")
    else:
        print("It does not match :(")
~~~

## Example bad implementation

The canton of Geneva open sourced their electronic voting system (CHVote) on [GitHub](https://github.com/republique-et-canton-de-geneve/chvote-1-0) requesting developers and security researchers to inspect the code. I reported a timing attack vulnerability to them responsibly via email. A day later, [@kAworu](https://github.com/kAworu) kindly submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/republique-et-canton-de-geneve/chvote-1-0/pull/10) to solve this issue.

The code is Java, but the same rules apply. CHVote was using a byte-by-byte comparison function for the MAC values.

~~~
return Arrays.equals(knownMac, calculatedMac);
~~~

As noted in the response from the CHVote security team there were several other layers of defense in place which would have prevented this type of attack from being carried out.
